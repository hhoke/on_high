  I sweep back the shower curtain, and immediately notice something on the medicine cabinet. It is a beetle. Solitary, surrounded by mirror, it clings to the vertical face. I am taken in by his short, curved weevil's snout. A pleasant surprise. But, a glance away, the windowsill is littered with insect carcasses. I wonder if he understands the predicament he has gotten himself into. In fact, I wonder if he can make anything of me, or the mirror, or the house, at all.

  I feel uncomfortable, oddly self-conscious, looming here on the wrong side of awe. The world inhabited by animals below a certain size is so unlike the world I live in, I can barely grasp how different it is. Unlike the owl or the mouse, the tiny beetle has, I suspect, no way of seeing me in any way similar to the way that I consider myself. A bear may not understand a house, but certainly has some concept of a dwelling, and has the sense not to walk through a wall. A beetle crawls through some crevice without ever really knowing he has passed through a wall and entered my house. Waving his antennae and questing onward, he has no idea why the surface he walks across is covered with an unnatural dew. My eyes can follow the traces of his labored shuffling. But he is too low and too small. He can only shuffle. He will most likely die, lost inside something he could never hope to conceive of.

  I wonder if it is any better for animals of a more relatable size. A human could comprehend a map of cul de sacs and artificial ponds and understand it in a way a fox could not; but it is rarely the case that he does. The fact that a man can speak the word "subdivision" is immaterial. Like the fox, the man does not encounter a newly-developed subdivision on the subdivision's own terms. Perhaps the lawyer or the real estate developer or the civil engineer comes closer, each in their own way. But an ordinary person only experiences the subdivision through the ways it impacts his immediate life. Perhaps, also, the foreseeable future -- if he is forward-thinking.

  What is global climate change to a polar bear? I wonder if they could give a name to the thing destroying them. They probably don't even understand that there is some thing destroying them; each only understanding their own individual demise. I begin to appreciate why people pray for guidance from on high.

  I look down on this beetle, and I wonder where you have to stand to see how I am going to die.

  Will he even know that he is lost? How does a beetle feel lost? I can only guess the ways in which he would perceive that his environment is strange and increasingly unfamiliar. Hurting and unfixed in the world, adrift in ways he could not possibly be prepared for. The best I can do is cherish him for a moment before I turn away. He is encrusted with droplets of shower mist. They catch the light, glimmering, cold and soft. I am struck by his color, a rich, dark slate blending in to bright, pale green. It must hide him so well, there, where he ought to be.
